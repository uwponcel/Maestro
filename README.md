### Sharp Note Keybinds

Most song transcribers use **F1-F5 (Profession Skills)** for sharp notes. This avoids conflicts with NumPad 0-9, which GW2 uses for natural notes.

### GW2 Keybinds

Match your module settings to your in-game instrument keybinds. Sharp keybinds must not conflict with natural note keybinds -- the defaults avoid this by using NumPad for natural notes and Alt + number row for sharps.
