## 🎵 Maestro

A Blish HUD module that plays music on GW2 instruments.

- Simple play, pause, and stop controls

### 📥 Installation

### ⌨️ Keyboard Setup

Songs use NumPad keys for notes and octave control. Piano songs may also use Alt+1 through Alt+5 for sharp notes. Match your module settings to your GW2 instrument keybinds.

#### Natural Notes (All Instruments)
| Key | Note | GW2 Skill |
|-----|------|-----------|
| NumPad1 | C | Weapon 1 |
| NumPad2 | D | Weapon 2 |
| NumPad3 | E | Weapon 3 |
| NumPad4 | F | Weapon 4 |
| NumPad5 | G | Weapon 5 |
| NumPad6 | A | Healing |
| NumPad7 | B | Utility 1 |
| NumPad8 | High C | Utility 2 |
| NumPad0 | Octave Down | Utility 3 |
| NumPad9 | Octave Up | Elite |

#### Sharp Notes (Piano Only)
| Key | Note | GW2 Skill |
|-----|------|-----------|
| Alt+1 | C# | Profession 1 |
| Alt+2 | D# | Profession 2 |
| Alt+3 | F# | Profession 3 |
| Alt+4 | G# | Profession 4 |
| Alt+5 | A# | Profession 5 |

**Note:** E# and B# don't exist as distinct notes in music (E# = F, B# = C).

**Important:** Sharp keybinds must not conflict with natural note keybinds. The default setup avoids this by using NumPad for natural notes and Alt + number row for sharps. If you rebind a natural note to a key that's used for sharps (e.g., "1"), that sharp won't work.
