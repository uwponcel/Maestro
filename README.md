#### Why F1-F5 for Sharp Notes?
Most song script writers use **F1-F5 (Profession Skills)** for piano sharp notes. This avoids conflicts with NumPad
0-9, which is already used for natural notes. Since the Music Box consumable item doesn't support piano (only Harp,
Lute, and Bass), piano songs require the Piano Chair bundle—and while sitting, Profession Skills (F1-F5) remain available for sharp notes.

#### GW2 Keybinds
Match your module settings to your GW2 instrument keybinds.
**Important:** Sharp keybinds must not conflict with natural note keybinds. The default setup avoids this by using NumPad for natural notes and Alt + number row for sharps. If you rebind a natural note to a key that's used for sharps (e.g., "1"), that sharp won't work.
